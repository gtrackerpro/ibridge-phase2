## 📋 Setup and Installation

### Project Structure Note
📁 **This is a monorepo** with separate client (Angular) and server (Node.js) applications, each with their own dependencies. The root `package.json` contains scripts to manage both applications together.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- AWS S3 bucket
- npm or yarn

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the server directory based on `.env.example`
3. Configure MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and AWS credentials

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root - Install all dependencies at once
npm run install:all

# Start both client and server in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Alternative: Manual Setup

#### Client Setup
```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

#### Server Setup
```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Important Note
⚠️ **Do not run `npm install` from the project root alone** - this is a monorepo with separate client and server dependencies. Always use `npm run install:all` to install all dependencies properly.
